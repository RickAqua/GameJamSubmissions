My submission for the "Turbo Makes Games - DOTS Jam 1".

I had very little time because I had my defence for MSc Software Engineering this week, so it is an unfinished prototype. But I learned a lot. I made a rudimentary First Person Camera Controller, an activation System and a movement system for Entities.
